# multiphysics_GCA
This code can be used to simulate the laser-induced crystallization of phase change materials
This code is used to calculate the laser-induced crystallization on phase change materials
It combines laser heating, GCA, effective medium theory and Fresnel equations
Sample structure: 50nm SiN + 30nm GST
This code is programmed by MATLAB, please use MATLAB to run it.
